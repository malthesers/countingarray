# Counting Array

Made as part of KEA's multimedia design, during third semester front-end development course.

Observe the madness at https://malthesers.github.io/countingarray/.

Eye warning: very blank white screen.

## Instructions
Open the console log and witness how the array adds number after number, until the length of the array is 9.

Thereafter the lowest number simply gets yeeted and deleted.
